Please check if you are inside the folder with the script and maps when compiling the code.
to run the code, open the directory consisting the script itself and map and compile/run script. 
The file is not pre-compiled since it can be open on different OS. 

In the directory you can find 3 maps, the map is a .txt file with 0,1 separated by comas. 
it can be modified according to representation: 

	'0'-represents wall, 
	'1'-represents path we can access, 
	'2'-start, 
	'3'-finish. 

There is no limit on size of map

IMPORTANT:
For the correctness please place outer walls for the maze. The algorithm will stop when it goes outside of map. 

To scecify map, you need to change file name of map on line 36 in the sript 'bfs_and_dfs.py'. 

	Example: maze = extract_map('map.txt') to maze = extract_map('map2.txt').

The program itself is a console application, when the script is running you will be asked to type in name of algorithm you want to use(all options displayed.). 
Type the name of algorithm you want to test or 'end' to stop the script.
