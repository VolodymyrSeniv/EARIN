## Getting started
If you want to start the code, you must use Prolog and its online environment “swi-prolog” for quick experiments with no installation.
https://swish.swi-prolog.org/

While testing you have to use two functions:
    add_date(date(year, month, day), number_of_days, NewDate) - where:
    year: is your provided year
    month: is your provided month
    day: is your provided day
    number_of_days: is your provided number of days

    sub_date(date(year, month, day), number_of_days, NewDate) - where:
    year: is your provided year
    month: is your provided month
    day: is your provided day
    number_of_days: is your provided number of days

The output will be given in the following way:
    NewDate = date(year,month,date) - where:
    year: is a result year
    month: is a result month
    day: is a result day
